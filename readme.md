# 16299 Lab 2
In this web page, I describe how I built a LQR model to control a Twip in simulation.

## The Twip Model

The provided model can be seen below:

```
function [whdd thdd] = twip2( wh, whd, th, thd, motor_command )

% The parameters we assume we know perfectly
r_w = 0.0323; % m - wheel radius - easy to measure
g = 9.81; % m/s^2

% My best guess as to parameter values for unknown parameters
m_w = 0.173; % kg
m_p = 0.826; % kg
I_w = 0.0066; % kg-m^2
l_p = 0.043; % m
I_p = 0.00084; % kg-m^2
motor_viscosity = 0.0095; % Nm-s/radian
torque_scale_factor = 0.004; % Nm/command_units

% This version is expressed in terms of 3 unknown inertial parameters p1, p2, and p3
p1 = I_w + (m_p + m_w)*r_w*r_w; % a moment of inertia about the contact point
p2 = m_p*l_p; % a mass moment for the pendulum
p3 = I_p + m_p*l_p*l_p; % a moment of inertia of the pendulum about the wheel axle

% Compute the "mass" matrix in terms of the three inertial parameters p_i:
m12 = p1 + p2*r_w*cos(th);
M = [ p1  m12
      m12 (p1 + 2*p2*r_w*cos(th) + p3) ];
Minv = inv(M);

% Compute the right hand side (rhs) of the dynamics equations
v_exp = p2*r_w*thd*thd*sin(th);
v = [ (-torque_scale_factor*motor_command + v_exp - motor_viscosity*whd) (v_exp + p2*g*sin(th)) ];
rhs = transpose( v );

% And compute the accelerations
result = Minv*rhs;
whdd = result(1);
thdd = result(2);

end
```

I began by first trying to understand how the provided twip model worked and how it differed from the model in the previous homework. The provided model took in a twip state and a motor command and computed the accelerations. I extended this model to compute the new twip state by double integrating over a fixed timestep of 1/100 seconds.

```
function [wh_new whd_new whdd_new th_new thd_new thdd_new] = model(wh, whd, th, thd, u)

global DT;

% compute accelerations
[whdd_new thdd_new] = twip2(wh, whd, th, thd, u);

% compute velocities
vels = [whd thd] + [whdd_new thdd_new]*DT;
whd_new = vels(1);
thd_new = vels(2);

% compute positions
pos = [wh th] + [whd_new thd_new]*DT;
wh_new = pos(1);
th_new = pos(2);
```

## Computing A and B Matrices for LQR

In order to compute the A and B matrices for the twip, I initially tried to reverse engineer the code in the twip model file but found it too complicated. I had hoped that I could come up with a clean algebraic formulation and linearize the model that way. I ended up computing the jacobian of the model with respect to the state variables and commands centered around `x=[0,0,0,0]` and `u=[0]` via the finite difference method:

```f’(x) = (f(x+delta) - f(x-delta)) / (2 * delta)```

Using this jacobian, I was able to find the A and B matrices via using the tangent line approximation formula. The code can be seen below:

```
delta = .01;
DT = 1/100;
A = zeros(4);
% wh whd th thd
init_state = [0,0,0,0];
init_u = 0;

for i = 1:4
    u = init_u;
    state = init_state;
    state(i) = state(i) - delta;
    [wh_new whd_new whdd_new th_new thd_new thdd_new] = model(state(1), state(2), state(3), state(4), u);
    res_low = [wh_new, whd_new, th_new, thd_new];

    state = init_state;
    state(i) = state(i) + delta;
    [wh_new whd_new whdd_new th_new thd_new thdd_new] = model(state(1), state(2), state(3), state(4), u);
    res_high = [wh_new, whd_new, th_new, thd_new];

    deriv = (res_high - res_low) / (2*delta);
    A(:,i) = deriv;
end

state = init_state;
u = init_u - delta;
[wh_new whd_new whdd_new th_new thd_new thdd_new] = model(state(1), state(2), state(3), state(4), u);
res_low = [wh_new, whd_new, th_new, thd_new];

state = init_state;
u = init_u + delta;
[wh_new whd_new whdd_new th_new thd_new thdd_new] = model(state(1), state(2), state(3), state(4), u);
res_high = [wh_new, whd_new, th_new, thd_new];

B = (res_high - res_low) / (2*delta);
```

The computed LQR matrices can be seen below:
```
A =
    1.0000    0.0093   -0.0183         0
         0    0.9303   -1.8256         0
         0    0.0005    1.0159    0.0100
         0    0.0498    1.5873    1.0000


B =
   -0.0003   -0.0293    0.0002    0.0210
```

## Picking Q and R Matrices for LQR

I chose initial Q and R matrices to be the identity matrices as a first guess and it worked reasonably well in that the twip balanced. However, I noticed that it drifted to the side a fair bit. 

I realized that we needed to punish motor commands less in order to allow the controller to be more aggressive. As this is a simulator and there is no real “cost” for sending motor commands like battery power or physical limits, I set R to be extremely small. 

Additionally, I wanted to strongly penalize body angle th over all other metrics as a high absolute body angle typically signified disaster (tipping over). After trying a couple variations, I found the following to work well at keeping the twip upright and getting it to return to origin quickly.

```
Q = [ 20 0 0 0
      0 3 0 0
      0 0 50 0
      0 0 0 3 ];
R = .01;
```

## Computing LQR Gains

I used the MATLAB function `dlqr` to compute the LQR gains. The code can be seen below:
```
[Kc Sc Ec] = dlqr( A, B', Q, R )

Kc =

   31.4089   27.9839  399.4821   61.6703


Sc =

   1.0e+04 *

    0.1630    0.0504    0.3927    0.0719
    0.0504    0.0311    0.2443    0.0443
    0.3927    0.2443    2.1682    0.3597
    0.0719    0.0443    0.3597    0.0650


Ec =

   0.9683 + 0.0023i
   0.9683 - 0.0023i
   0.9473 + 0.0000i
   0.5166 + 0.0000i
```
